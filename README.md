## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am the info Baron.
...well...
not so much an info baron now as I plan to be in the next three...ish years.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...nothing...yet...ouh, wee!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... computer science (*cries a little) at Miva Open University. I'm also taking Harvard's free crash cs50 course on C language and the fundamentals of programming. Wish me luck.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... nothing ...yet...ouh, wee! To be fair, this would change pretty soon (soon meaning a few weeks, depending on how intense progaming gets me)
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... an internship, perhaps? I could use practical experience as a valid tool to aid my software develpoment journey.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Search "Mitchel Enebeli" on facebook. The coolest, most handsome looking account is mine. Alternatively, you could email me at 'mitchel.enebeli@miva.edu.ng'
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: Dell XPS 13 plus/Lenovo ThinkPad (in case you thought you read wrong on my bioğŸ˜‚). Realistically, though, it's he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a writer. I like to pride myself on the fact that I write novels, blogposts and codes...which seem like two opposing sides of the spectrum. I also once dreamt in C. It was terrifying.

See you around, then.ğŸ˜ƒ
